# FUNCTION SUMMRY :

**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**

-  Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

**DECLARING A FUNCTIONS :**

- To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

 - Somtimes a function needs specific informaion to perform its task. 

    In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters.

    inside the function, the parameters act like variables .

**CALLING FUNCTIONS :**

- Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly bracs with just one line of code .

- When you call a function that has parameters, you specfy the values it shoul use in the parentheses that follow its name .

    The values are called arguments, and the can provided as values or as variables .


**GETTING A SINGLE VALUE OUT OF A FUNCTIONS :**

Some functions return information to the code that called them .
