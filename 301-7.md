# APIs Continued:

**About Roy Fielding:**

- He's smart.

- He helped write the first web servers, it's all pretty amazing really. And the funny thing is that it's all very undervalued. 

- The protocol I mentioned, that he helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.

- The first part of the url https tell browser what protocol to use here its HTTP.

- A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts.

- Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

- Representations is one of these things that doesn't get used a lot. In most cases, a resource has only a single representation, there's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

- Verbs are important. There's a powerful concept in programming and CS theory called “polymorphism”. That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.

- This is what engineers do in the web development world, thanks almost entirely to the popularity of RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
