# Object literals

**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT:

VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties tell us about the object.

IN AN OBJECT:

FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS
If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.

**CREATING AN OBJECT:**

- LITERAL NOTATION :
Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects(there are several ways to create objects)

- ACCESSING AN OBJECT AND DONT NATATION:

    You access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. You can also access properties using square brachets.
