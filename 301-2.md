# jQUERY

**What is jQuery??**

- jQuery is a javaScript file that you include in ypur web pages. It lets you to :

1- Find elements using css-style selectors.

2- Do somthing with the elements using jQuery methods.

**Why use jQuery?**

- jQuery dosen't do anything you connot atchive with pure javaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

1- SIMPLE SELECTORS :

As you saw in Chapter 5, which introduced the DOM, it is not always easy to select the elements that you want to.

2- COMMON TASKS IN LESS CODE :

There are some tasks that front-end developers
need to do regularly, such as loop through the elements that have been selected.

3- CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:

jQuery automatically handles the inconsistent ways in which browsers select elements and handle events, so you do not need to write cross-browser fallback code.

**A MATCHED SET / JQUERY SELECTION:**

When you select one or more elements, ajQuery object is returned. It is also known as a matched set or a jquery selection.

1- Single element:

- If a selector returns one element, the jQuery object contains a reference to just one element node.

2- Multiple elements:

- If the selector returns several elements, the jQuery object references to each element.

**JQUERY METHODS THAT GET AND SET DATA:**

- Some jQuery methods both retrive information form, and update the contents of, elements. But they don't always apply to all elements.

**JQUERY OBJECTS STORE REFERENCES TO ELEMENTS:**

- When you create a selection with jQuery, it stores a refernce to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree. It does not create copies of them.

**CACHING JQUERY SELECTIONS IN VARIABLES:**

- A jQuery object stores refernces to elements.
Caching jQuery object stores a refernce to it in a variable.

**CHICHING A PAGE IS READY TO WORK WITH:**

jQuery's .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with.

**WAYS TO INCLUDE JQUREY IN YOUR PAGE:**

In addition to hosting the jQuery file with the rest of your website, you can also use a version that is hosted by other companies. However, you shuld stil include a fallback version.

***Pair Programming:***

- How does pair programming work?

1- The Driver.

2- The Navigator

- Why pair program?

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming:**

1- Greater efficiency.

2- Engaged collaboration.

3- Learning from fellow students.

4- Social skills.

5- Job interview readiness.

6- Work environment readiness.
