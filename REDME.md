# *Mind Growth Mindset*

- The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately. The growth mindset can be a consistent way or a path to more creativity and possibility to set and achieve higher goals .

## *What is a growth mindset?*

- **A** -  A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning. A growth mindset believes that most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work using intelligence and talent.


*Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset :*

- **B** - Challenges :

try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When you’re ready, walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. 

- **C** - Obstacles* : 


It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.

- **D** - Effort : 

The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset!

- **E** - Criticism :


review each day and assess how you’ve done. Ask yourself some question such as:

   - 1 - What was the best part of the day?

  -  2 - What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?

- **F** - Success of others :


Growth mindset leads you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration.

 ## *Growing at work, and outside work too* :

- The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective. Taking the time to assess what you’re doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work.

- Try focus and remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of the abilities – if you just stay with it.
