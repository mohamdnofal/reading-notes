# HEROKU

**Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js:**

- This tutorial will have you deploying a Node.js app to Heroku in minutes.

**Set up:**

- In this step you’ll install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). You use the CLI to manage and scale your applications, provision add-ons, view your application logs, and run your application locally.

- When installation completes, you can use the heroku command from your terminal.(heroku login command to log in to the Heroku).

- Before you continue, check that you have the prerequisites installed properly. Type each command below and make sure it displays the version you have installed. (Your versions might be different from the example.) If no version is returned, go back to the introduction of this tutorial and install the prerequisites.

**Prepare the app:**

- To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

( 1- git clone `https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git`

2- cd node-js-getting-started )

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

**Deploy the app:**

- Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.

- When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

Heroku generates a random name (in this case sharp-rain-871) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name. 

To deploy the app:

**View logs:**

- Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.

- View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, heroku logs --tail.
