# Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

**CSS grid:**

- CSS grid is now supported in Samsung internet v6.2 and many other modern browsers and has been the answer to many a prayer of web developers everywhere. In the same way that flexbox gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming simpler.

**Grid properties:**

1- display:

- Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

- values:

A- grid – generates a block-level

B- grid
inline-grid – generates an inline-level grid

2- grid-template-columns & 
grid-template-rows:

- Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

Values:

A- `<track-size>` – can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the fr unit).

B- `<line-name>` – an arbitrary name of your choosing.

3- grid-template-areas:

- Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.

Values:

A- `<grid-area-name>` – the name of a grid area specified with grid-area.

B- . – a period signifies an empty grid cell.

C- none – no grid areas are defined.

4 - column-gap
row-gap
grid-column-gap
grid-row-gap

- Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like setting the width of the gutters between the columns/rows.

Values:

`<line-size>` – a length value.

5- justify-items:

- Aligns grid items along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-items which aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

Values:

A- start – aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell.

B- end – aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell.

C- center – aligns items in the center of their cell.

D- stretch – fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default).

6- align-items:

- Aligns grid items along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-items which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

Values:

A- start – aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell.

B- end – aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell.

C- center – aligns items in the center of their cell.

D- stretch – fills the whole height of the cell (this is the default).

7- place-items:

- place-items sets both the align-items and justify-items properties in a single declaration.

Values:

- `<align-items>`  `<justify-items>` – The first value sets align-items, the second value justify-items.
