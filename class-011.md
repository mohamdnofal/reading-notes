# IMAGES

**CHAPTER:**

***Controlling size of images in CSS:***

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

***BackgroUnd Images:***

- The background-image property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

    The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

***image rollovers & sprites***

- Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.

***contrast of Background Images:***

- If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# PRACTICAL INFORMATION

**CHAPTER 19:**

***search engine oPtimization (seo):***

- SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**On-Page seo:**

- In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.

**How to identify keyWords and Phrases:**

- Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO.

***Analytics: learning about your Visitors:***

- As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

**How many people are coming to your site?**

- The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.

**What are your Visitors looking at?**

- The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.

**Where are your visitors coming from:**

- The traffic sources link on the left hand side allows you to learn where your visitors are coming from.

***domain names & hosting:***

- In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting.

- 1- *Domain names:*

Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.
These sites usually have a form that allows you to check whether your preferred domain name is available, and because millions of domain names have already been registered, it might take you a while to find the one that is right for your site.

- 2- *Web hosting:*

So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.
With the exception of some very large sites, most websites live on web servers run by web hosting companies. This is usually far cheaper and more reliable than trying to run your own web servers.
