 **Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
 you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections :**

- 1- **What is a script and how do i create one ?**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

- 2- **How do computers fit in with the world around them?**


- 3- **How do I write a script for a wep page ?**


To write a script, you need to :

- A- Define the goal .
- B- Design the script .
- C- Code each step .

# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES :

- 1- The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.

- 2- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.

- 3- You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something .

- 4- All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

- 5- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores .

- 6- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

*** 
**Arrays :**

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values .

**VALUES IN ARRAYS :**

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

***
**EXPRESSIONS :**

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions :

- 1- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable .

- 2- Expresstions that use tow or more values to return a single value .
