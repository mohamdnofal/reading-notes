# SMACSS and RWD

With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as RWD.

***Responsive Overview:***

- Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

- Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

- Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media:

1- **flexible-layouts:**

- These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

3- **Media Queries:**

- Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances.

- There are a couple different ways to use media queries: 

1- Using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet.

2-  Importing a new style sheet using the @import rule.

3- Generally speaking it is recommend to use the @media rule.

- Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.


- Mobile First:

One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

3- **Flexible Media:**

- Equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

- One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.

# Float

**What is “Float”?**

- Float is a CSS positioning property.

**What are floats used for?**

- Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

**Clearing the Float:**

- Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.

**The Great Collapse:**

- One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn’t always obvious if the parent doesn’t contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

**Techniques for Clearing Floats:**

- If you are in a situation where you always know what the succeeding element is going to be, you can apply the clear: both; value to that element and go about your business. This is ideal as it requires no fancy hacks and no additional elements making it perfectly semantic.

1- The Empty Div Method.

2- The Overflow Method.

3- The Easy Clearing Method.

**Problems with Floats:**

- Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.
