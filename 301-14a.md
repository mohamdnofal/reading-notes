# DB Normalization

**Introduction to Database Normalization:**

- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:

1- Identify salespeople in your organization.

2- List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product.

3- Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.

- By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

**Reasons for Database Normalization:**

- There are three main reasons to normalize a database.  The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries.

**Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies:**

- Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:

1- It increases storage and decrease performance.

2- It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
