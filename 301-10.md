# The Call Stack and Debugging

- A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

**The JavaScript Call Stack:**

- The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

**What causes a stack overflow?**

- A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

**error messages && debugging:**

- Most of your time as a developer is spent reading code followed by debugging that same code, most likely to be able to read it or solve an “unexpected feature” (which, joking aside, is more correctly known as a “bug”).

**Types of error messages:**

1- Reference errors

2- Syntax errors.

3- Range errors.

4- Type errors.

**Debugging:**

A- To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

B- The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

C- You can also add conditional breakpoints by right-clicking a previous set breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met, this is awesome for when you want to debug huge cycles for specific values.
