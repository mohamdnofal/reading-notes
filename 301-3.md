# Flexbox and Templating

**Javascript Templating Language and Engine— Mustache.js with Node and Express:**

- Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

**Mustache:**

- Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object. 

- mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

**Mustache-Express:**

- If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily.
